There isn't a direct replacement for `node.js` in your scenario since Node.js is the runtime environment that executes JavaScript code, which seems to be the core functionality of your `betiniawara842/my-calculator-app` image.

However, depending on the nature of your calculator app, there could be alternative approaches:

1. **Pure Web Application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
   - If your calculator is entirely a client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you might not need Node.js at all. You could use a simpler image like:
     - **nginx:** A lightweight web server for serving static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - **Apache httpd:** Another popular web server option.

2. **Backend with Different Language:**
   - If your calculator requires server-side logic beyond pure JavaScript (e.g., database interaction), consider using a different language and its corresponding image. Some options include:
     - **Python:** Popular for web development with frameworks like Flask or Django. You'd use a Python image like `python:3.11-slim`.
     - **Java:** Widely used enterprise language. Images like `openjdk:19-slim` can be used.
     - **Go:** Known for its simplicity and performance. You could use an image like `golang:1.20-alpine`.

**Choosing the Right Image:**

The best image choice depends on the specific programming language used in the backend (if any) of your calculator app. If you're unsure, referring to the documentation or source code of `betiniawara842/my-calculator-app` should provide insights.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Dockerfile Modifications:** If you decide to switch to a different image or language, you'll likely need to modify the Dockerfile for `betiniawara842/my-calculator-app` to reflect the new environment and build process.
- **Learning Curve:** If you're unfamiliar with the target language, there'll be a learning curve involved. Consider the complexity of your calculator app and your team's expertise when making a decision.

By understanding the role of Node.js and exploring alternative approaches based on your application's functionality, you can choose the most suitable path to get your calculator app running effectively within a Docker container.
